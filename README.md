- **Load Balancing**: AWS Load Balancer distributes traffic across healthy instances, maintaining service availability.

### Observability

- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Log Aggregation**: Efficient log aggregation and troubleshooting with Loki.

## Getting Started

This section provides detailed instructions for setting up the infrastructure, deploying applications, and configuring various services on AWS and EKS.

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Kubernetes CLI
- Helm

### Deployment Steps

#### Infrastructure Setup

1. **VPC Configuration**: Set up VPC with custom subnets and NAT gateways in AWS.
2. **EKS Cluster Creation**: Create an EKS cluster across multiple availability zones for high availability.
3. **Amazon RDS Setup**: Configure Amazon RDS with a high availability setup for the MySQL database.
4. **Load Balancer Configuration**: Set up AWS Load Balancer to manage traffic distribution.
5. **Route 53 Setup**: Configure Route 53 for domain management and routing.

#### Application Deployment

1. **Frontend & Backend Deployment**: Deploy the React frontend and Node.js backend applications to the EKS cluster.
2. **Database Connectivity**: Ensure the backend is connected to the MySQL database on RDS.

#### Security Configuration

1. **Secrets Management**: Integrate AWS Secrets Manager for secure handling of sensitive data.
2. **Ingress & Certificates**: Install and configure the Ingress controller and Cert Manager for secure application access.

#### Monitoring & Logging

1. **Observability Stack**: Deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for monitoring and logging of application performance and health.

#### Security Scanning

1. **Continuous Security & Code Quality**: Utilize Trivy for vulnerability scanning and SonarQube for code quality checks.

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup
